# InDaFlow
As the only programmer on the team I was able to whip up a productivity application thats build for students primarily in years K to 12, however more geared towards
kids in primary school who are just beginning their journey managing homework loads.

The web applications contains 4 tool that are able to be tested and used by the students. Of course a productivty app isn't complete without a way to keep track
of homework. "ScribblePro" as it's so eloquently named allows students to emulate physical sticky notes in a digital format. Our brains are meant to come up with
great idea, not store them. So this tool allows students to write quick notes about things that are on their mind so they can view these great thoughts later on.
The tool "(dot)ism" is essentially a to-do list for students to keepe track of the tasks they have pending, and there is nothing more satisfying than crossing off
a task of a to-do list. As well as getting students to use productivity tools, we also need to educate on how to be more productive. The last two tools "Flow and 
"Learn" are used to teach people different study techniques such as the Pomeodoro technique and also teach them how to learn by means of effective note-taking 
and such.

Due to the short time period I wasn't about to hook a backend to this project and add logins and storage for user content. Nevertheless, this tool was build to
simplify the learning process and maximise the efficency of work being done by the user. As a result all the to-dos and notes made by the user were meant to 
disappear after the study session with the goals of the studnent and required work being completed so they would have a clean slate for their next batch of work.
